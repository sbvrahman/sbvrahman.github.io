  <h1>Subaita Rahman</h1>
  <p>I’ve spent over five years supporting early-stage life sciences startups, VCs, and founders helping translate breakthrough research into scalable, real-world impact. Currently, I work with teams on operations and commercial strategy. Alongside, I’m building new initiatives in women’s health.</p>

  <p>Previously I worked on product operations at Recursion/VL, was a founding team member of Ephla Bio, supported Pillar VC’s bio investing team, and built and scaled Nucleate Dojo. A core part of the work I do is around democratizing access to scientific innovation. I believe the world’s greatest resource is human potential, and that science will solve some of the most important problems in our century.</p>

  <p>I'm most interested in startup ecosystems, new funding models, venture creation, and scientific R&D for women's health.</p>

    <h2>Consultancy</h2>
    <p>I help early-stage biotech and healthcare startups (pre-seed to Series A) scale strategically and build early commercial traction. I focus on go-to-market strategy, customer discovery, marketing, and operational systems that drive growth. I work with teams to identify early users, shape their value proposition, run targeted go-to-market experiments, and align product and commercial efforts through streamlined internal systems.</p>
    <p>Clients include startups in biotech, diagnostics, AI in bio, medtech, and climate-health.</p>

    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>Previously, I was part of <strong>Valence Labs</strong> (powered by Recursion) as a Product Operations Associate working on product launch and growth for the BioML community. Prior to that, I led strategy and partnerships at <strong>Ephla Bio</strong>, a stealth biotech company in the immunotherapy space. I also spent a year in venture capital working with <strong>Pillar VC’s bio platform team</strong> in Boston where I supported their bio investment team in sourcing companies across the US/EU.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Founded</h2>
    <p>I co-founded <strong>Nucleate Dojo</strong>, a global biotech platform and talent hub enabling undergraduates to contribute to the biotech industry through tailored education, tight-knit communities, and capital (M&A with Nucleate in 2021). Within Nucleate Dojo, I created several programs including the <strong>DojoHouse</strong>, the first ever biotech-themed co-living house for undergraduate professionals.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>I’ve done undergraduate research across tissue engineering and proteogenomics. My final year thesis with the <strong>Cox Lab</strong> focused on differential gene expression analysis of single cell seq pregnancy-induced hypertrophic cardiac tissue. I previously worked with the <strong>McGuigan Lab</strong> on the development of a 3D tumour tissue model for drug testing, and conducted my third-year thesis project with the <strong>Allen Lab</strong> on crossing the BBB for glioblastoma treatment.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Other Work</h2>
    <p>Currently a mentor for <strong>FemTech Labs</strong> in the UK. I’ve consulted with <strong>Ochre Bio</strong> to supercharge internal and external comms and community to prepare for a Series A round launch. I’ve also mentored teams for <strong>BioHackNYC</strong> and worked with <strong>U of T Entrepreneurship</strong> to strengthen community across 12+ incubators and over 100 startups.</p>
